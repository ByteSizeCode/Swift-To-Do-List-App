## Note:

This app saves as it enters the background (such as when the user closes the app). Keep in mind that simply building and running the app from Xcode, terminating, and running again will not save app data. In order to test properly:
1. Build and run from Xcode or open from homescreen if already installed
2. When done, close app to save data. Exiting to the home screen is sufficient.
